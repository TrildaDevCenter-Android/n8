 * # Navigation
 *
 * This model is the source of truth for the navigation state of an app. The navigation state
 * principally describes the locations that were visited by a user to reach their current location.
 *
 * Public functions provide for navigating forward and backwards as the user navigates
 * around the app. In the most basic case this involves pushing new locations on to a backstack
 * when navigating forwards, and popping locations off a backstack when navigating backwards.
 *
 * The navigation state also handles an arbitrary number of nested navigation schemes such as you
 * might use for Tab style UI layouts (with each tab represented as its own backstack). Here public
 * functions enable the user to switch to previously visited tabs (with their own back stacks),
 * or backing out of the tabs entirely.
 *
 * This navigation scheme is built up using 3 Node types:
 *
 * - EndNodes (representing a single location)
 * - BackStacks (a mixed list of EndNodes and TabHosts)
 * - TabHosts (a list of BackStacks)
 *
 * The top level Node is always a BackStack
 *
 * The simplest implementation would therefore be a BackStack containing a number of EndNodes with
 * the last EndNode in the BackStack representing the current location, and the first EndNode
 * representing the home location.
 *
 * Aside from the forward / backwards navigation functions, the navigation state can also be
 * completely rewritten or reordered at will to provide for custom navigation schemes or the
 * handling of deep links etc..
 *
 * # Observable State
 *
 * The state exposed by this model is persisted across rotation or process death with PerSista
 * (PerSista stores data classes as json on the file system). This navigation model is also
 * observable, meaning that any time its navigation state changes (when there is a
 * navigation to a new location) all observers of this model are notified that the state has
 * changed. The observing code (which will typically be UI code) can interrogate the
 * currentLocation (to redraw its UI for example)
 *
 * # Pure Kotlin
 *
 * This is pure kotlin logic, there is no dependency on Android or even Compose, and there is
 * minimal coupling between an app's screen classes and the n8 library because the "Location" class
 * is entirely defined by client code, it just needs to be serializable to play nicely with
 * persistence (a sealed class would be a good candidate - see the example).
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * It's not necessary to define the navigation graph beforehand, the backstack just keeps track of
 * whatever navigation operations are performed via the public functions, these functions allow you
 * to pass arbitrary data forwards or backwards, reuse previous locations, optionally not save a
 * location to the backstack at all, or arbitrarily rewrite the backstack as you wish. Nested
 * back stacks are supported for youtube style tab implementations
 *
 * Example usage below, but see the UnitTests for the definitive guide to the behaviour of the
 * public functions
 *
 *
 * Example Locations:
 *
 * sealed class Location {
 *
 *     data object NewYork : Location()
 *
 *     data object Tokyo : Location()
 *
 *     data class Sydney(val withSunCreamFactor: Int? = null) : Location()
 *
 *     data object SunCreamSelector: Location()
 *
 *     sealed class EuropeanLocations : Location() {
 *
 *         data object London : EuropeanLocations()
 *
 *         data object Paris : EuropeanLocations()
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * instantiate:
 * NavigationModel(homeLocation = London)
 *
 *
 * A. Regular forward navigation
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 *
 * backstack: London > Paris > NewYork
 * currentLocation: NewYork
 *
 *
 * B. Regular back navigation
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * popBackStack()
 *
 * backstack: London > Paris
 * currentLocation: Paris
 *
 *
 * C. Back navigation multiple steps
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * popBackStack(times = 2)
 *
 * backstack: London
 * currentLocation: London
 *
 *
 * D. Visiting locations more than once
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(Tokyo)
 *
 * backstack: London > Paris > NewYork > Paris > Tokyo
 * currentLocation: Tokyo
 *
 *
 * E. Recycling previous locations
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris) (OR just use navigateBackTo(Paris) each time, see example F.)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * navigateTo(London)
 * navigateBackTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(Tokyo)
 *
 * backstack: London > Paris > Tokyo
 * currentLocation: Tokyo
 *
 *
 * F. Recycling previous locations when they were never visited in the first place
 *
 * navigateTo(Sydney)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * navigateBackTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(Tokyo)
 *
 * backstack: London > Sydney > NewYork > Paris > Tokyo
 * currentLocation: Tokyo
 *
 *
 * G. Visiting a location that you don't want added to the back stack
 *
 * navigateTo(Sydney)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * navigateTo(Paris, addToHistory = false)
 * navigateTo(Tokyo)
 *
 * backstack: London > Sydney > NewYork > Tokyo
 * currentLocation: Tokyo
 *
 *
 * H. Passing data forward to a new Location
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * navigateTo(Sydney(withSunCreamFactor = 50))
 *
 * backstack: London > Paris > NewYork > Sydney(50)
 * currentLocation: Sydney(50)
 *
 *
 * I. Returning data from the current Location to a Location further back in the stack
 *
 * navigateTo(Paris)
 * navigateTo(NewYork)
 * navigateTo(Sydney)
 * navigateTo(SunCreamSelector)
 * popBackStack { it -> // the new current location after popping backstack i.e. Sydney
 *    when(it){
 *      Sydney -> it.copy(withSunCreamFactor = 30)
 *      else -> it
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * backstack: London > Paris > NewYork > Sydney(30)
 * currentLocation: Sydney(30)
 *
 *
 * J. Arbitrarily rewriting the entire backstack
 *
 * updateBackStack(
 *    listOf(
 *      Paris,
 *      London,
 *      Sydney(50),
 *      Tokyo,
 *      London
 *    )
 * )
 *
 * backstack: Paris > London > Sydney(50) > Tokyo > London
 * currentLocation: London
